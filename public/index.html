    About Me
    </h2>
    <div class="aboutMe">
      <p>
      My name is Alef Gomes Matias, I'm 30 years old and I decided recently to change my career.<br>
      I'm a Systems and Development Analysis student at the Cruzeiro do Sul and I discovered the programming world in 2014.<br>
      I'm a very curious person and I love to learn new things, I'm always looking for new challenges and new knowledge.
      Otherwise, How coul I become a web developper being actually a Sushiman?<br>
      With a lot of dedication and study, I'm sure that I will be able to achieve my goals and become a great professional in the area.<br>
      That the reason why i decided to join the College again.
      I'm so glad you took your precious time to see what I have to say about myself. I hope you enjoyed to read it.
      Hope to see you soon. Thank you.
      </p>
