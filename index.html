        About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
        My name is Alef Gomes Matias, I'm 30 years old and I decided recently to change my career.<br>
        I'm a Systems and Development Analysis student at the Cruzeiro do Sul and I discovered the programming world in 2014.<br>
        I'm a very curious person and I love to learn new things, I'm always looking for new challenges and new knowledge.
        Otherwise, How coul I become a web developper being actually a Sushiman?<br>
        With a lot of dedication and study, I'm sure that I will be able to achieve my goals and become a great professional in the area.<br>
        That the reason why i decided to join the College again.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm so glad you took your precious time to see what I have to say about myself. I hope you enjoyed to read it.
        Hope to see you soon. Thank you.
        </p>
